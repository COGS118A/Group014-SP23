    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "The data contains information about a telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict customer churn. One goal is identifying which factors are most strongly associated with churn. I will use various models and algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to compare their performance. And I will use techniques such as cross validation to select the best model. The success will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score: they will give me a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. The ultimate goal is helping the telecom company to better understand their customers and take proactive steps to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention."

The motive for studying this sort of problem is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a company's service so that the companies could come up with proactive schemes to retain their customers and maintain the stability of revenue flows. One hypothesis is that the tenure would be one of the deciding factors: longer then tenure, less likely the customer churn would happen. This is because intuitively people were less likely to make a change when they stick with the company for a long time.\n",

    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",

    "In this problem, I need to predict customer churn for a telecommunication company with supervised machine learning methods. Here is a definition of Customer Churn: it is a phenomenon that customers stop doing business with a company and switch to that company's competitor. In the context of a teleco company, churn can be caused by various factors such as increased price, poor customer service, and better offers from competitors. The problem is quantifiable because the ultimate goal is predicting whether a customer will churn or not (binary classification) based on features such as their tenure, contract type, payment method, etc. Such problem could be further can be expressed with classification algorithms to predict customer churn. I could measure the performance of the algorithms and models with a rainbow of metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve. The problem is replicable since it can be reproduced using the same dataset and features to train and test various supervised machine learning models to predict customer churn for other similar companies or for a same company with data in the future."

Another important variable is \"Tenure,\" which represents the length of time a customer has been with the company. This variable would have a significant impact on a customer's likelihood of churning for the reason that customers who have been with the company for a longer period of time may be more likely to stay.\n",
