    "In this project, we want to predict customer churn for a telecom company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM company. The data contains information about a telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict customer churn. One goal is identifying which factors are most strongly associated with churn. I will use various models and algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to compare their performance. And I will use techniques such as cross validation to select the best model. The success will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score: they will give me a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. The ultimate goal is helping the telecom company to better understand their customers and take proactive steps to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention."

    "Customer churn prediction is a crucial problem in the field of business analytics. It has been studied extensively by practitioners from various field in the business world<a name=\"name1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#name1n). The motive for studying this sort of problem is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a company's service so that the companies could come up with proactive schemes to retain their customers and maintain the stability of revenue flows. One hypothesis is that the tenure would be one of the deciding factors: longer then tenure, less likely the customer churn would happen. This is because intuitively people were less likely to make a change when they used the service from the company for a long time. Intuitively, their consumption habits may not change drastically.\\\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, I need to predict customer churn for a telecommunication company with supervised machine learning methods. Here is a definition of Customer Churn: it is a phenomenon that customers stop doing business with a company and switch to that company's competitor. In the context of a teleco company, churn can be caused by various factors such as increased price, poor customer service, and better offers from competitors. The problem is quantifiable because the ultimate goal is predicting whether a customer will churn or not (binary classification) based on features such as their tenure, contract type, payment method, etc. Such problem could be further expressed with classification algorithms. I could measure the performance of the algorithms and models with a rainbow of metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve. The problem is replicable since it can be reproduced using the same dataset and features to train and test various supervised machine learning models to predict customer churn for other similar companies or for a same company with data in the future."

In the context of customer churn, aregular SVM would work fine. We can use it to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on various features like their tenure, demographics, usage patterns, etc. It is also a great algorithm for data that need to draw nonlinear decision boundaries. We could use the kernel trick to map the original features to a higher dimensional space.\n",

The training process is basically storing the data. The testing could consume more time as it needs to calculate the distance pairwise. In the context of customer churn, we can use KNN to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on the similar customers in the training set.\n",
    "    * **Logistic Classification**\\\n",

    "Reports should have a __narrative__. Once you've looked through all your results over the quarter, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you went down any blind alleys that you later decided to not pursue, please don't abuse the TAs time by throwing in 81 lines of code and 4 plots related to something you actually abandoned.  Consider deleting things that are not important to your narrative.  If its slightly relevant to the narrative or you just want us to know you tried something, you could keep it in by summarizing the result in this report in a sentence or two, moving the actual analysis to another file in your repo, and providing us a link to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely have different subsections as you go through your report. For instance you might start with an analysis of the dataset/problem and from there you might be able to draw out the kinds of algorithms that are / aren't appropriate to tackle the solution.  Or something else completely if this isn't the way your project works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Another likely section is if you are doing any feature selection through cross-validation or hand-design/validation of features/transformations of the data\n",

    "### Subsection 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably you need to describe the base model and demonstrate its performance.  Maybe you include a learning curve to show whether you have enough data to do train/validate/test split or have to go to k-folds or LOOCV or ???\n",

    "Perhaps some exploration of the model selection (hyper-parameters) or algorithm selection task. Validation curves, plots showing the variability of perfromance across folds of the cross-validation, etc. If you're doing one, the outcome of the null hypothesis test or parsimony principle check to show how you are selecting the best model.\n",

    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a tool to help you address the potential issues such as https://deon.drivendata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "For the customer churn project, the privacy of the customers should be a top concern. Specifically, the dataset contains variables that may reveal customers' consuming habits in telecon services, and we want to protect the customers' privacy by eliminating the information that help identify individuals. Besides this, the customers should be notified that their data is used for the prediction. And fortuantely, the customers appearing in our dataset are anonymous, meaning that their privacy is protected. The id numbers in the dataset does not reveal any personal information, and thus it will not do harm to customers' privacy.When the models are trained and put into daily practice by the company, certain issues should be considered deliberately. For example, all the customers should be noted that their data would be used, and the customers should have the right to opt out anytime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
